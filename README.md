# Using Machine Learning Models to Analyze the Aerodynamic Properties of Airfoils

## Introduction

My name is Aaron Wong. I am a 18 year old senior at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey. Over the past three months, I have worked on this project, using machine learning and specifically neural networks to analyze the aerodynamic properties of airfoils giving certain geometric data (thickness, camber, etc.) and image data of the airfoil in an x,y plane.  

## Description

This research shows the potential benefits of Machine Learning in aerodynamics, specifically its ability to predict aerodynamic properties from data given, which could bypass expensive wind tunnel tests and computationally heavy simulations. Using free GPUs from Google Collaboratory and basic hardware, one test was able to predict 58.6% of airfoils that it hadn't seen before (test data) after being trained by training data.
